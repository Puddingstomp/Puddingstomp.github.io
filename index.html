  <p>Welcome! My name is Jonathan Grubb, and I'm currently attending the Awesome Inc. University Fall 2017 web development bootcamp. I'm a huge car buff and have always had a passion for <a href="https://www.instagram.com/definitely.not.grubb/" target="_blank">modifying import vehicles.</a> If I'm not at the computer trying to acquire knowledge on web development and new programming languages or gaming, then I'm definitely in the garage tinkering with my car or taking something apart. From building computers, to home automation, to modifying cars, I've always had a desire to not just learn how to do things, but learn why systems work and find new ways to make them better.</p>
